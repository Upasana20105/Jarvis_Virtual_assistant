# Jarvis_Virtual_assistant

This is a comprehensive, interactive README.md designed for a GitHub repository. It includes visual elements, clear setup instructions, and highlights the specific features found in your code, such as the Arc Reactor UI, Gemini AI integration, and the Music Library.🤖 JARVIS: Advanced Virtual AssistantJARVIS (Just A Rather Very Intelligent System) is a dual-interface voice assistant. It features a desktop-based automation script and a stunning, futuristic web interface inspired by Iron Man's Arc Reactor.✨ Features🎙️ Dual Mode Interaction: Use the CLI via main.py for direct system control or the Web UI via app.py.🧠 Personal Memory: Remembers your name and favorite programming language using memory.json.🎵 Smart Music Library: Integrated playback for your favorite tracks (Radha, Perfect, Snowman, etc.) with partial match search.🌐 Web Automation: Quick commands to open Google, YouTube, and LinkedIn.📰 Live News: Fetches the top 5 global headlines on demand.🤖 Gemini AI Integration: For queries not handled by local logic, JARVIS consults Google's Gemini Flash model for intelligent responses.🚀 Quick Start1. PrerequisitesEnsure you have Python installed, then install the required dependencies:Bashpip install -r requirements.txt
2. ConfigurationOpen jarvis_core.py and ensure your API keys are set (or use environment variables):NewsAPI: Used for fetching headlines.Gemini API: Powering the advanced AI reasoning.3. Running JARVISYou can run JARVIS in two ways:Option A: The Web Interface (Recommended)Bashpython app.py
Navigate to http://127.0.0.1:5000 to see the animated Arc Reactor boot sequence.Option B: The Desktop AssistantBashpython main.py
Say "Jarvis" to wake him up and start giving commands.🛠️ Project StructureFileDescriptionapp.pyFlask server hosting the web interface.main.pyLocal voice recognition loop (Wake word: "Jarvis").jarvis_core.pyThe "Brain" containing command logic and AI processing.musicLibrary.pyDictionary of songs and their YouTube links.index.htmlFuturistic UI with CSS animations and Speech-to-Text.memory.jsonPersistent storage for user preferences.⌨️ Example CommandsIdentify Yourself: "My name is Upasana" → "What is my name?"Music: "Play Snowman" or "Play Perfect"Web: "Open YouTube" or "Open LinkedIn"Knowledge: "How does quantum computing work?" (Handled by Gemini AI)Updates: "Give me the news"🎨 UI PreviewThe web interface features a custom Boot Sequence that checks system modules before initializing the voice interface. The Arc Reactor pulses rhythmically and speeds up when JARVIS is actively "listening" to your commands.🤝 ContributingFeel free to fork this project, add new songs to musicLibrary.py, or expand the processCommand logic in jarvis_core.py to support more automation!Developed by Upasana
